# Smart Box Inventory System
## Challenge Summary
A simple, intuitive web-based app to track and locate items stored in boxes across various locations like home, office, or during a move. Ideal for managing clutter and finding items efficiently using a QR code system.

## Description
This challenge aims to address the common problem of managing and finding items stored in boxes, whether at home, in the office, or during a move. Moving can be especially chaotic, as you need to pack everything into boxes and later find it again. 

This app helps organize that process by enabling users to create locations, add boxes, and manage items within those boxes. Users can generate and print QR codes for each box, making it easy to scan and instantly retrieve details about the box's contents. The app should include a search feature that allows users to find specific items or boxes quickly, showing where the box is stored and its assigned number. In "search mode," the app could utilize the camera to recognize and highlight the correct QR code, guiding users to the correct box. 

Additionally, incorporating AI could make item entry easier by recognizing items via the camera. The app is web-based, with potential for mobile apps on iOS and Android for ease of use. This challenge is highly relevant for anyone who frequently organizes boxes or relocates, and it opens the door for innovation in terms of AI-assisted item recognition and QR code integration. 

The goals of this challenge are to create an easy-to-use inventory system that simplifies item tracking, especially during major life events like moving.
